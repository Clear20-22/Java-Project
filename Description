This is a DU Cafeteria Management project developed in Java. The system includes a login system with two types of users:

Teachers & Students: They can log in using their registration ID and password after signing up for the cafeteria.
Admin & Employees:
The admin can log in using a unique ID and password.
Employees require the admin’s permission along with their ID and password to access the system.
For security, users can recover their password using a predefined codeword in case they forget it.
